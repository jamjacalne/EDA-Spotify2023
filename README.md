# **Exploratory Data Analysis on Spotify 2023 Dataset**

## Overview of Dataset
**1. How many rows and columns does the dataset contain?**

When Python loads the .csv file, it declares a dataset with 953 rows and 24 columns.

**2. What are the data types of each column? Are there any missing values?**

The `.dtypes` attribute was used to extract the data types of each column.

## Basic Descriptive Statistics
**1. What are the mean, median, and standard deviation of the streams column?**

The mean, median, and standard deviation of the streams are 514137424.93907565, 290530915.0, 566856949.0388832 respectively. These are extracted using the pandas function `.mean`, `.median`, and `.std`.

**2. What is the distribution of released_year and artist_count? Are there any noticeable trends or outliers?**

## Top Performers
**1. Which track has the highest number of streams? Display the top 5 most streamed tracks.**

The streams column was passed to the `.sort_value` function to extract the streams in order. Since this function sorts from lowest to highest (ascending) values, the `.tail` function was called. 

**2. Who are the top 5 most frequent artists based on the number of tracks in the dataset?**

The `.value_counts()` function was used to extract the frequency of each artistâ€™s appearances in the dataset, ranking the artists with the most streamed songs.

## Temporal Trends
**1. Analyze the trends in the number of tracks released over time. Plot the number of tracks released per year.**

To analyze trends in track releases per year, a line plot was created using the matplotlib library, clearly visualizing the rise and fall of trends over time.

**2. Does the number of tracks released per month follow any noticeable patterns? Which month sees the most releases?**

Using the matplotlib library, a bar plot was created to analyze patterns in track releases per month. The plot shows spikes in January and May, making these the months with the most streamed tracks.

## Genre and Music Characteristics
**1. Examine the correlation between streams and musical attributes like bpm, danceability_%, and energy_%. Which attributes seem to influence streams the most?**

To analyze the correlation between streams and musical attributes, the correlation matrix is first calculated using the `.corr()` function on a DataFrame containing only streams and the relevant musical attributes. The correlation matrix is then visualized with `sns.heatmap` from Seaborn. By sorting the correlation values using `.sort_values()`, it is identified that danceability, with a correlation of -0.105457, has the highest absolute correlation with streams. However, this is a weak negative correlation, so it does not strongly influence streams. 

**2. Is there a correlation between danceability_% and energy_%? How about valence_% and acousticness_%?**

Using `.loc`, specific correlations between danceability_% and energy_%, and between valence_% and acousticness_% were accessed for further analysis..

## Platform Popularity
**1. How do the numbers of tracks in spotify_playlists, spotify_charts, and apple_playlists compare? Which platform seems to favor the most popular tracks?**

To better visualize the comparison between the number of tracks in Spotify playlists, Spotify charts, and Apple playlists, the `.plot` function from Matplotlib is used to create a bar chart. The total number of appearances for each platform is calculated directly from the relevant columns and used `.replace` to format the platform names by replacing underscores with spaces for readability. The results reveal that Spotify playlists have a significantly higher representation of tracks compared to Spotify charts and Apple playlists, suggesting that Spotify playlists may favor popular tracks more extensively.

## Advanced Analysis
**1. Based on the streams data, can you identify any patterns among tracks with the same key or mode (Major vs. Minor)?**

**2. Do certain genres or artists consistently appear in more playlists or charts? Perform an analysis to compare the most frequently appearing artists in playlists or charts.**
